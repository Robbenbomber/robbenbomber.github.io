Hello World! I've finally managed to set this blog up, using the kind help of [Rose](https://rose1440.is-a.dev/)! Be sure to check them and their blog out.

A few things about me:
- I am Holly, also known as Robbenbomber
- I love developing games, doing graphics design and working on web stuff
- I had issues MASSIVE issues setting this stupid blog up, as I've never used Github before
- I made [Waffl_zz Website](https://wafflzz.xyz) and Waffl_zz [Overlay](https://twitch.tv/waffl_zz), which you can find on his Twitch, which I linked
- I am grinding the gym (2026 will be my year!!)

and thats about it...

I plan on using this blog for personal ideas, transitioning and self improvement documentation. Thank you for reading this and stay tuned for any new updates!
